## Known Issues

1. Some media may prevent `$.jPlayer.event.ended` from being fired, causing next media cannot be played automatically.
2. Haven't test in different browsers.

### Who is Lyrica?
> Lyrica Prismriver is a "poltergeist (phantom, or ghost)". She's able to play her musical instrument without actually touching, just like her sisters.
